The Challenge:
We need to build a tool with the following capabilities:

Automated Ingestion: The tool should check the website at regular intervals (e.g., daily or at new intervals) to identify and download the latest target list files.

Example: The most recent file is 2025-02-07_12-20-02_DDoSia-target-list-full.json.
Database Storage: Once downloaded, the tool should ingest the target lists into a database where the data can be structured and queried efficiently.

Threat Profiling & Correlation: Use the database to build detailed threat profiles. Enable querying to analyze past attacks and correlate data to identify patterns and trends.

Monitoring & Alerts: Implement monitoring with alerting mechanisms to notify us when any target from our internal watchlist appears on the threat actor's list.

Visualization Dashboard: Design and develop a React-based dashboard for visualizing:

Past attack history
Threat actor profiles
Correlations and timeline-based analysis


DDoS Target Intelligence Tracker
Project Description
The DDoS Target Intelligence Tracker is a tool designed to monitor, analyze, and track DDoS targeting patterns from a specific threat actor group through automated collection and analysis of their target lists. The tool ingests data from witha.name, which publishes reverse-engineered target lists from DDoSia malware, providing valuable threat intelligence about ongoing and planned DDoS attacks.
Core Features

Automated Data Collection


Downloads JSON target lists from witha.name
Tracks new target lists using timestamp-based filenames (e.g., 2025-02-07_12-20-02)
Archives original JSON files for reference


Target Intelligence Database

SQLite-based storage for easy deployment
Tracks target history including first and last seen dates
Maps attack patterns and methods
Geographic analysis using TLD grouping

Analysis Capabilities

Current targets overview: Shows active DDoS targets
Historical tracking: When targets were first/last seen
Attack pattern analysis: Methods and frequencies
Geographic distribution through TLD analysis


Search & Monitoring

Quick target lookup functionality
Target history tracking
Watchlist monitoring for specific domains
Basic alerting for watchlist matches

Key Benefits
Threat Intelligence
